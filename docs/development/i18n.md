    English messages: [benefits/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po](https://github.com/cal-itp/benefits/blob/dev/benefits/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po)

The Cal-ITP Benefits application is fully internationalized and available in both English and Spanish.

It uses Django's built-in support for translation using [message files](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/#term-message-file), which contain entries of `msgid`/`msgstr` pairs. The `msgid` is referenced in source code so that Django takes care of showing the `msgstr` for the user's language.

## Updating message files

Django has a utility command called `makemessages` to help maintain message files. It ensures that `msgid`s in the message files are actually used somewhere in source code and also detects new `msgid`s.

There is a helper script that runs this command with some arguments: [`bin/makemessages.sh`](https://github.com/cal-itp/benefits/blob/dev/bin/makemessages.sh)

```bash
bin/makemessages.sh
```

Developers should use this script to update message files in a consistent way.

## Workflow

### Updating `msgstr`s

Updates to `msgstr`s should be done directly in the message files. Run the helper script so Django can update the formatting if it needs to.

### Adding or removing `msgid`s

When a `msgid` is added to or removed from source code (e.g. Python code or Django templates), the helper script should be run so Django can update the message files. Then, you will need to provide the `msgstr` value for any `msgid`s that you added.

### Changing `msgid`s

When a `msgid` is changed, you can optionally change the corresponding `msgid` in the message files, but make sure to also run the helper script so that Django can update the ordering and formatting if it needs to.

### Fuzzy strings

From [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/translation/#message-files):

> `makemessages` sometimes generates translation entries marked as fuzzy, e.g. when translations are inferred from previously translated strings.

Usually, the inferred translation is [not correct](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/10852#comment:3), so make sure to review the `msgstr` and fix it if necessary. Then, remove the commented lines starting with `#, fuzzy` (otherwise the entry will not be used).
