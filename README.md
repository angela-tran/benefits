## Token signing and encryption

The Eligiblity Verification API makes use of Signed and Encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWS, JWE, JWT) as a means of data transfer.

A public/private keypair must be generated by each party (Benefits Client and Eligibility Verification Server). [Example keys](./keys)
are included for the test verification server and sample agencies.
